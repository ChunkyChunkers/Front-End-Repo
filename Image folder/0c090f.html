I loved it’ - Sarah Hilary, author of Fragile ‘I couldn’t put The Interview down. Totally brilliant’ - B A Paris, author of The Therapist ‘A terrifying, heart-stopping ride’ - Sharon Bolton, author of The Split ‘So tense and twisty.

EPILOGUE

AUTHOR’S NOTE

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS





For Jack





A fist bangs on a sheet of glass.

Bangs again.

On one side of the glass, all is still and hushed.

On the other side, the air sings with sh; outs and screams.

A hundred and thirty feet up, in the middle of a city of nine million people, and nobody hears or sees a thing.

Friday 5.03 p.m.


The worst thing that can happen to you in an interview is getting caught in a lie. Everybody knows that. It was one more thing for me to stress about as I waited to get inside 55 Ludgate Hill.

‘Come on, come on.’

The revolving glass doors were moving too slowly. Anguish tugged at my insides. I darted forwards and back, forwards and back, then finally burst free and bolted for the front desk. There were three security personnel on duty: one woman, two men. Behind them was a back room where I could see a grid of surveillance monitors flickering against a wall.

‘My name is Kate Harding.’ I was panting, short of breath. ‘I’m late for a 5 p.m. appointment with Edge Communications.’

‘I see.’ The guard nearest to me lifted a phone to his ear. He had a stiff, business-like demeanour. Early sixties, balding with a moustache, dressed in a navy blazer with shiny brass buttons. ‘Let me call up for you. Sign the visitor book, please.’

I grabbed a pen, scrawled down my details. My hand was shaking. I could feel perspiration bubbling on the back of my neck despite the cool lobby air.

Had I blown it already? After waiting all day Friday, a Tube delay had forced me to run here from Blackfriars Station. I’d had anxiety dreams where I was late for my interview. Now it was actually happening.

Then there was my CV. Why had I added that line about swimming? I suppose it wasn’t a total lie. I used to enjoy swimming. A long time ago, I was a member of a club. It had been a much more sociable way to stay fit than the gruelling dawn jogs I’d been taking around Tooting Common for the past nine months. But if they asked about the last time I’d been swimming, I’d have no idea what to say. It was definitely before my life was upended. Everything was.

The guard set down his phone. ‘They’re sending someone down to collect you, but they’re running a little behind themselves, so they’ve asked if you could take a seat for the time being.’

He pointed to an area behind me and I spun to take in the lavish atrium for the first time. The lobby was enormous. There was a lot of glass and steel. Acres of limestone flooring. Far in the distance, a group of black leather sofas were arranged near a trio of gleaming elevators.

‘Go right ahead. They’ll find you.’

To one side of the elevators, water cascaded down over a wall of rippled slate tiles into an infinity pool. To the other, a living wall was filled with plants in varying shades of green. In the foreground, professional men and women in office attire bustled to and fro. Some held mobile phones to their ears. Others carried briefcases or document folders. Most appeared to be hurrying for the exit and, I guessed, home for the weekend.

You used to be just like them, I told myself. But somehow it only made me feel like more of an imposter.

‘And if I may, Miss – good luck.’

I cringed. ‘Is it that obvious? How nervous do I look exactly?’

The guard’s two colleagues looked up from their duties and joined him in indulging me with smiles.

‘Less than some,’ he said. ‘You may prefer not to hear this, but they’ve been interviewing for most of the day. But Edge Communications? I’d say you’ll fit right in.’

I wished. Once, maybe, but right now I felt daunted. The glitzy atrium wasn’t simply impressive – it was imposing. And just hearing about the other candidates who’d been interviewed before me was enough for my doubts to resurface in a major way.

Not for the first time I told myself that I should have said no when Maggie, my recruitment agent, had set up this interview. Deep down, I knew I’d been too easily flattered when she’d told me that my past campaigns had impressed the team at Edge. Now I found myself wondering if Maggie had lied flat out. And . . . Oh God. What if the team had never actually heard of me and this was all a huge waste of time?

No, I told myself. Focus.

I knew I was in danger of spiralling. Knew that if I wasn’t careful the swirl of negative thoughts would take hold of me and put me in a spin. In the quiet centre of my mind I conjured the calm, reassuring mantra of my counsellor, a wise and worn mother of two I meet with once a fortnight in Hackney: Now is not the time.

And it wasn’t. It couldn’t be. I was stepping out of my comfort zone here – no use pretending otherwise – but I’d lived and breathed this world before. I could do it again.

‘Miss? Was there something else?’

‘No, I’m fine. But thank you for your help.’

I edged away from the desk, my heels echoing into the void. June in London. There was so much sunlight streaming into the atrium I had to raise my hand to shield my eyes from the dazzle.

Ahead of me, a cleaner in grey overalls was using a noisy handheld machine to polish the floor. I could smell the cleaning fluid he was spraying – something cloying and strangely familiar that conjured up a memory I really didn’t need. For a dizzying moment, I could have been striding across an airport concourse again, hurrying towards a press briefing. The stutter of flashbulbs. The clamour of questions. The choking surge of emotions at the back of my throat.

A job interview.

Why was I putting myself through this?

But in the pit of my stomach, I knew the answer to that question. I was doing it because this interview might – or might not – change everything.

Joel White’s pulse quickened as he watched Kate cross the light-filled atrium. He’d watched her from the moment she’d entered the building. He’d watched her every second since.

He watched her now, and she didn’t know it, because he was standing high up on a glass walkway that criss-crossed the lobby far below, just an anonymous employee in a shirt and tie standing alongside a second man in an expensive suit, who might have been a colleague, but wasn’t.

The man standing alongside him was thin, grey-haired, grim-faced. He seemed to have shrunk a size or two since his suit was last tailored and his bunched hands were wrapped around the steel banister in front of him, wringing it so tightly the metal squeaked. A high-profile businessman who’d amassed a vast personal fortune, he was a millionaire, maybe even a billionaire on paper – rich enough, anyway, that the distinction no longer mattered a great deal.

‘Do you have everything you need?’ the man asked, in a voice that was wheezing and constricted, a combination of ill-health, stress and deep unease. Throat cancer, Joel speculated, though he hadn’t asked and wouldn’t be told if he did.

He also didn’t respond to the man’s question. Years of conducting interviews, years of applying his own particular skills in locations all across the globe, and still it amazed him how the big beasts of the corporate world could crumble and fall apart when their reputations and livelihoods were on the line. When that happened, often enough, they would turn to him.

‘I asked you a question.’ The man’s voice pinched and strained. ‘I was assured you wouldn’t let me down.’

Again, Joel ignored him. The bank of elevators was behind them and he turned without comment to press the call button. When an elevator arrived, he paused for a second before stepping in, glancing briefly at the leather folio case the man had handed him and then staring one last time at Kate Harding. As he watched her, he could feel himself changing. A contraction of his muscles. A hardening of his resolve. A low-level burning like acid in his blood.

‘Answer your phone when I call you,’ he told the man as the elevator doors slid closed. ‘I’ll get you what you need.’

Friday 5.06 p.m.


I was close to the seating area when a woman stepped out from behind a tall plant to my side and took hold of my arm. ‘I don’t want you thinking I do this for all my clients,’ she whispered in my ear.

‘Maggie?’

‘Sit down. Smile. Let’s both just pretend you’re not late and I’m not having a fit about it. You can ignore my missed calls when you finally check your phone, by the way.’

‘What are you doing here?’

‘My job.’ Maggie tugged me down into one of the sofas, taking the seat next to me and placing her handbag on her lap. Her handbag was large and no-nonsense, much like Maggie herself. She had a mop of strawberry blonde hair, keenly intelligent green eyes. Her olive trouser suit was generous at the bosom and hips, worn over a plunging white blouse. ‘It’s Friday evening, Kate. I was in the neighbourhood.’

‘Your office is in Dulwich.’

‘So I’m protecting my investment. You do know I get a bonus if you land this job?’

I peered at her. In the Zoom calls we’d had on and off during the past fortnight, I’d placed Maggie as just a few years older than me, in her mid-to-late thirties. Now, though, the fine lines around her eyes and mouth told me she was some way past forty.

‘Did you think I wouldn’t show up?’ I asked her.

‘It’s probably best I don’t answer that. You look great, by the way.’

I glanced down, unconvinced, still worried my look was too formal and safe for a company like Edge. I’d gone with a black pencil skirt and matching jacket over a blush silk blouse that had cost far more than I could afford to spend on it. I’d been to my local salon first thing this morning. Nothing fancy. Just a trim and a tidy-up of my fringe. Look closely, though, and you would have seen the insomnia-bags under my eyes, the hollows in my cheeks. I suppose I was lucky that the four years I’d worked as cabin crew before switching to a career in PR had taught me all the make-up tricks anyone could care to know.

‘Maggie, the security guard just told me Edge have been interviewing all day.’

‘Why worry about it? You’re the one they’ll want. Trust me. They’ll have applicants with general PR experience coming out of their ears, but nobody with your background in the travel industry.’

‘How many candidates did you send them?’

‘Just you.’

I gave her a dubious look.

‘Seriously.’ She seized my hands in her fleshy palms. ‘Kate, how many times do I have to tell you this role is perfect for you and you’re perfect for this role? I wouldn’t have stuck with you if I didn’t believe that. Not after you tried to talk us both out of it enough times.’

Her brusque show of support warmed me, even as the doubts rose up in me again. It was strange to think how someone I’d only spoken with over the phone or in online meetings before now had become such a force in my life in such a short space of time. Maggie had been tenacious when she’d first approached me just over two weeks ago, even as I’d told her (less and less convincingly) that I wasn’t interested in a new job. I’m not sure whether that said more about how persistent Maggie was or how much of a loner I’d become. Secretly, I knew that if she hadn’t reached out to me in the first place, told me I was wasting my talents at Simple, I could have continued in the miserable rut I’d been in for months, maybe years.

‘Breathe,’ Maggie said. ‘Relax. Take a look around with me for a second. Didn’t I tell you this place was incredible?’

Together, we looked up at the lobby as the chlorinated waterfall babbled softly behind us.

And she was right. It was incredible. 55 Ludgate Hill – popularly known as The Mirror – was London’s most recent statement high-rise building. At thirty-eight storeys high, it dwarfed the dome of nearby St Paul’s Cathedral, although its signature feature was the way the exterior above the triple-height lobby was covered entirely in silvered, reflective glass panels. From outside the building nobody could see in to the uppermost floors, but I knew from my online research that they offered breathtaking views across the Thames and beyond.

The Mirror had only been officially opened in February, but there were already rumours that the company behind the project was on the verge of going bust. Construction on the site had begun before the global Covid pandemic and now that the building was completed, the business world had changed. More and more people were working from home and that meant fewer firms were looking to rent prime office space in the City. The penthouse restaurant that had grabbed press attention because of its celebrity chef was yet to open to the public, and there was talk that multiple floors remained unlet and unoccupied. That fitted with what I was seeing in the lobby. There were people here, but nowhere near as many as the project’s backers must have planned for.

I found that weird. Maybe I was in the minority, but I had zero interest in working from home, and not just because my one-bedroom flat in Balham was dingy and depressing. One of the attractions of the pitch Maggie had made to me about working at Edge was the distraction a busy office could provide. My counsellor had told me it was time to put myself out there, take risks, scare myself.

Mission accomplished, I thought now.

‘I still feel bad about Simon and Rebecca,’ I told Maggie. ‘They’ve been good to me.’

‘And I get that. Believe me, I’d be worried if a client of mine didn’t feel guilty about leaving their current job. But you’re not doing anything wrong here, Kate. You know you’re not.’

I glanced down at my hands, not feeling so sure about that. Simon and Rebecca were the husband and wife team who owned Simple PR. I was their only outside hire. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that they took me on more out of sympathy than need. They’d been incredibly patient as I’d built my confidence back – feeling my way into the working world again – being ready with guidance and advice. I hadn’t yet had the courage to tell them I was interviewing for another position.

‘Kate, listen to me. It’s comfortable where you are. It’s safe and I understand that. But you’re a star. You know it, I know it. And Edge are the best at what they do. You belong where you belong.’

I managed a half-smile. ‘Have you been practising that?’

‘Little bit. Did it work?’

I hummed, the knot of guilt inside me still making it difficult to admit – even to myself – that the lure of working for Edge was the main reason I was here. Edge had fancy offices in London, New York and Sydney. They represented top-tier clients and brands across the fields of entertainment, sports and business. There were even whispers of a roster of high-end clients they never openly discussed.

Like the company name suggested, Edge were best known for high-profile campaigns that were hip and wildly inventive. The kind of noisy campaigns Simon and Rebecca would roll their eyes at, because at Simple we generally did the same things Simon and Rebecca had always done – targeting traditional media, aiming for an older demographic.

Like Maggie had said, it was safe. And by safe, I knew that what she really meant was ‘dull’.

I nodded, poised to thank her for coming, to summon up a show of confidence that could make her believe her faith in me hadn’t been misplaced, when my phone chimed from inside my handbag.

‘One second.’

‘Great.’ Maggie threw up her hands in mock exasperation. ‘Now she checks her phone.’

I parted my handbag, removed my iPhone. There was a short text message at the top of my lock screen.

Go for it, Sis. You’ll wow them. Guaranteed xx

‘My brother,’ I explained. ‘Wishing me luck.’

Even as I said it, a peevish thought struck me. It should be Mark texting me. Why can’t it be Mark? But almost as soon as the thought had surfaced, I immediately forced it back down. I couldn’t afford to think that way about my husband right now. It wouldn’t help. And I knew I should be grateful that my brother cared enough to send me a text in the frenzied seconds he had between patients. Luke works as a cardiac nurse at St Thomas’ Hospital. He’s my rock. Since we lost Mum and Dad almost a decade ago, within three cruel months of one another, he’s the closest family I have.

Beneath Luke’s text I could see that I also had two missed calls from Maggie’s phone as well as a news notification: MarshJet Trial Hears Evidence from Family of Deceased . . .

Too late, I snatched my eyes away, covering up my phone with my hand. My heart contracted in my chest.

Now is not the time. Now is not the—

‘Kate?’

My vision darkened, a sudden coolness sweeping in over my shoulders. I clamped down on the inside of my mouth, clenching my phone tight in my fist. Maggie squeezed my hands. Her touch felt clammy and hot.

‘Stay with me, Kate. You can do this. Just remember what I told you. They’re going to push you, ask you unconventional questions, get you to take part in dummy exercises, even. They’re all about doing things differently and surprising you. It’s who they are. But that’s OK. You’re ready for this. You’re going to do brilliantly, I promise.’

I nodded, forcing a smile, knowing that I was holding back from her. Because as much as I valued Maggie’s advice, there were some things I couldn’t talk with her about. Things I didn’t talk to anyone about except my counsellor.

‘Listen, there’s a pub across the road from this place, on the opposite corner.’ She rose to her feet. ‘Did you see it? I’m going to wait for you there. Come and find me when you’re done and we can celebrate together. OK?’

I winced.

‘Or commiserate, then. But no excuses. I won’t keep you late. I’m driving to Devon tonight to see my parents. But I’m in this for the long haul, Kate. We’ll find you your perfect role, at Edge or somewhere else if it comes to it.’ Her gaze shifted briefly and she nodded in the direction of the elevators. ‘Looks like this is your cue.’

I swivelled to see a smiling young blonde woman approaching me as Maggie backed off and drifted away. The woman was dressed in an on-trend jumpsuit over pristine white training shoes. The instant I saw her, I immediately worried that I was wrongly dressed, over-dressed, just too plain out of touch for Edge.

‘Kate Harding?’

I stood up, tugging at my skirt.

‘I’m Hayley.’ She thrust out her hand. ‘It’s so lovely to meet you. Shall we go upstairs?’

Upstairs in the offices of Edge Communications, Joel sat alone with his thoughts.

And the folio case.

He flicked through it methodically.

The case contained everything there was to know about Kate Harding. There was her CV, of course. That was front and centre. But there was much more besides. There was a detailed breakdown of her personal life and family history. Her social media profile. Her financial records and credit score. Her medical records. Her politics. Her passions. Her likes and dislikes.

Her fears.

He stopped on one of the surveillance photographs they had of her, his heart beating slowly in his chest.

It was a glossy colour print. The stock was high quality. The focus was sharp.

Kate was smiling in the picture. Her eyes sparkled. Her skin looked soft and wind-flushed. She was wearing a pink woollen beanie and fingerless gloves, holding a bouquet of flowers outside a market stall. It was raining and Joel could see bright beads of water glimmering in the light from a nearby cafe. But the part that pierced him, perhaps more today than it had with any of the other candidates he’d interviewed in the past, was how he could tell from the way she was glancing away from the camera, her gaze distant and unfocused, that she had no clue she was being photographed at all.

Friday 5.13 p.m.


Hayley pressed the button for the elevators. ‘Nervous?’ she asked me.

I held up my finger and thumb a fraction apart. In truth, I felt sick, dizzy, the knot in my stomach getting tighter and tighter, but I knew I had to be careful here. Hayley seemed nice but she could have been asked to report back on everything I said to her, how I behaved. Making the wrong comment or response right now could kill my chances before I’d begun.

‘I’m fine,’ I told her. ‘Excited.’

‘Great.’ Her eyes darted away from me for a second. ‘Oh, hey guys!’ She went up on her toes and waved at two workmen behind me. They were crossing the lobby in paint-spattered coveralls, carrying tool kits. ‘All finished?’

‘Almost,’ one of them called back. ‘Should be Tuesday now.’

‘Can‰?t wait! Have a great weekend, both!’ Hayley clapped her hands, then leaned closer to me. ‘We’re having a gym installed upstairs,’ she explained. ‘And listen, try not to stress about today. We’re a really friendly bunch at Edge. And if it helps at all, the guy interviewing you is seriously hot.’

The doors parted on one of the elevators and Hayley stepped in, but I didn’t follow. I was frozen.

‘Is there a problem?’ she asked me.

Yes, there was a problem.

‘I was told my interview was with Amanda Palmer.’

‘Oh. No, sorry. Amanda is with a client all day. Didn’t anybody let you know?’

I shook my head, searching behind me for Maggie, but she was already on her way out through the revolving glass doors, her attention on her phone. A sudden surge of dread took hold of me. Amanda Palmer was a Senior Account Director. I’d studied her bio on the Edge Communications website. I’d researched her on Google and LinkedIn. We shared similar backgrounds in the aerospace industry. I knew she’d worked in airline management before she’d joined Edge and I’d hoped it might give me an advantage.

Now I didn’t know what to think. Was this the kind of stunt Maggie had warned me about, a ploy to throw me off my game?

‘Who is interviewing me?’

‘His name’s Joel White.’

I mentally scanned through the other bios I’d seen on the Edge website but I didn’t get a hit on the name.

‘Relax, OK?’ Hayley beckoned me into the elevator and after another moment’s hesitation, I stepped in next to her. ‘He’s new. British, but he works out of our New York office. It looks like he’s going to be heading up recruitment from now on. Half the office are currently trying to find out if he’s single.’

‘He came all the way to London for these interviews?’

‘Yes, but don’t sound so surprised. They take hiring here really seriously. Plus they probably thought it would be a good chance for him to meet the London team.’ She pressed a button on the elevator panel. ‘We’re on floor thirteen, by the way. Amazing views, no street noise.’

Thirteen. Normally I didn’t believe in bad omens but with the way things had been going for me lately . . .

The doors had almost sealed when a hand appeared in the gap and they bounced apart again.

‘Sorry, sorry.’

The cleaner in the grey jumpsuit shuffled backwards into the elevator, wheeling his heavy floor-polishing machine after him. He was a big, brawny man with jet-black hair that was slicked down against his scalp. A pair of headphones hung around his neck.

‘Hey, Raul,’ Hayley said to him. ‘Please tell me you have some more photos to show me.’

Raul nodded and smiled toothily as he jabbed the button for floor eight. The doors sealed, the elevator began to rise, and he took a phone from his pocket, tapping it with his thumb and angling the screen for Hayley to see.

‘Cute!’ She smiled at me. ‘Raul’s wife had a baby girl last week.’

‘Zarita.’ His eyes blazed with pride as he thrust his phone my way.

For a second, I was tumbling. The photograph showed an attractive woman with dark hair cradling a newborn baby girl in a pink onesie.

Now is not the time . . . Now is not the . . .

I felt breathless. Trapped. Not so long ago, motherhood had seemed to be a pathway I was destined for. One that Mark had told me he was just as committed to as I was.

Turned out the universe had other plans.

‘Beautiful,’ I managed, aware that the knot in my stomach was unravelling, a hollowness ebbing in.

I lowered a hand to my waist as Raul slipped his phone away. Hayley noticed my reaction and shot me a concerned look. I could tell she was about to ask if I was feeling all right but at that moment the elevator slowed, bouncing to a halt on floor eight, and once the doors had parted Raul manhandled his machine out ahead of him.

‘See you,’ he called back.

‘Yes, see you later, Raul.’ When the doors had sealed and the elevator was humming upwards again, Hayley checked on me once more, then motioned towards the space Raul had occupied. ‘Raul’s a total sweetheart. He’s supposed to use the service elevator, but everybody here knows him and he’s so nice he totally gets away with it. Did you have any questions you wanted to ask me?’

I dug my nails into the palms of my hands, trying to draw my attention back to the here and now.

‘My recruitment agent mentioned that sometimes in the interview process here there can be exercises or . . .?’

‘Oh. Oh, listen, really don’t worry about that. I’m sure Joel will explain everything to you. My advice? If they offer you the job, take it. They’re a really great company to work for and we have so much fun. I work on reception with a guy called Justin. It’s his birthday today and we’re all going out for drinks later.’

That was something else Maggie had briefed me on. There was a work-hard, play-hard culture at Edge. The team were young, the hours long, the work demanding. Most people who landed a position here stuck it out for a couple of years to have Edge on their CV, and then burned out and moved on.

That wasn’t my plan. I wanted to be somewhere where the challenges were so intense they could consume me. Swallow me. Make me forget.

The elevator arrived at floor thirteen and this time Hayley led me out into a smart vestibule towards a pair of black, industrial-style metal doors. The doors were inset with thin panels of wired safety glass, flanked by fake topiary planters. Hayley took a key card from a pocket on her jumpsuit.

‘You’ve probably heard that most of the building is still unoccupied, which has its perks. Apparently the lease we signed was a total steal. We have the entire floor to ourselves.’

She wafted her key card in front of a metal sensor on the wall. A green diode lit up and she pushed a door open ahead of me.

‘Welcome to Edge.’

Friday 5.17 p.m.


The contrast from the opulent lobby downstairs was jarring. Edge’s reception area had a stripped back, industrial vibe. Bare cement floors. Exposed ceilings revealing ventilation ducts and piping. Unpainted steel girders. Distressed red-brick partition walls.

Directly in front of me was a semi-circular counter clad in mismatched boards of rough-hewn timber. Behind the counter, the Edge logo was picked out in pink neon tubing above a line of metal lockers. The latest Apple desktops were on show and a skinny guy in a V-neck sweater over a checked shirt and tie – Justin, presumably – was talking on the phone to somebody via a Bluetooth headset. Spray-painted across the front of the counter was the Edge company mantra: Break your own rules.

‘It’s this way.’

Hayley strode purposefully to her right and I hurried after her onto the main office floor. The space was almost entirely open-plan. Around the perimeter of the room I could see the building’s signature floor-to-ceiling windows, their silvered tint subtly dimming tantalizing glimpses of the London skyline.

‘Quick tour.’ Hayley waved a hand. ‘Workstations, obviously. We have a clean desk policy. That means all your work has to be tidied away at the end of each day. Any confidential notes or materials have to be filed or shredded.’

To my right, a series of white laminate desks were arranged in horseshoe clusters with low felt dividers separating them. The workstations featured all the usual office equipment. Desktop computers. Landline phones. Lamps. Ergonomic desk chairs. As Hayley had suggested, most of the desks were noticeably low on paperwork and the endless piles of daily clutter I was used to at Simple.

Positioned around the desks were perhaps thirty or so fashionably dressed employees, some sitting, others tapping at keyboards, still others chatting in small groups and cutting glances my way. Most of them looked like clones of Hayley or Justin.

‘Refectory.’

Hayley indicated a kitchen area to her left where a row of glossy white kitchen cabinets were lined up against a long brick wall running through the middle of the space. Fixed to the wall above them was a giant chalkboard with a grid system drawn on it.

‘That’s the master grid,’ Hayley explained. ‘Everything we do goes on that wall. Every campaign gets broken down into press targets, budgets, execs responsible, all the usual stuff. In the refectory you’ll find complimentary still and sparkling water, Coke, juice, smoothies. There’s coffee and tea. In the mornings we have cereal, fruit and muffins. Most evenings somebody orders in from Deliveroo or wherever.’

‘Perfect,’ I said, trying to act like it was normal for me to work somewhere with complimentary food and drink. At Simple, I generally ate the same sad packed lunch from the same sad Tupperware container at my desk every day. It was one of my responsibilities to boil the kettle and make tea or instant coffee for Simon and Rebecca whenever they asked.

‘Sometimes we hold meetings at the kitchen table. But usually we get together in small groups in one of the pods.’

Again, Hayley pointed, but none of the ‘pods’ as she called them were meeting rooms in any conventional sense. One appeared to be the shell of a classic VW campervan that had been fitted out with forwards and backwards facing seats and a table fashioned from a surfboard. Another was designed to look like the basket of a mock hot-air balloon that was half risen through the ceiling. There were two painted horses from a fairground carousel. A white gazebo with fake plants entwined around it.

‘We have a unisex bathroom behind reception. And at the back there you can see our games area.’

Hayley signalled to another young girl and a guy who were playing ping pong at a table splattered with luminous paint. Next to them was an arcade dance machine with flashing lights.

‘I’m top scorer.’ Hayley smiled over her shoulder. ‘And Justin is amazing at the climbing wall. If you take the job, you have to get him to show you.’

If I took the job. Like it could be that simple.

The climbing wall was at the back of the space beyond the games area. It extended all the way up to the ceiling and had the appearance of a giant pegboard with multicoloured hand- and footholds screwed to it. At the bottom of the wall were an array of crash mats and bean bags.

‘Unless you’re a demon climber already?’ she added.

I shook my head. ‘I’ve been abseiling. For a charity thing, at my old job.’

‘Did you love it?’

‘I did once I reached the ground.’

‘Don’t tell anyone I said this, but if you have a hangover, those bean bags make a great spot to take a nap.’

As Hayley led me on, I noticed other features she didn’t point out. A library area with see-through inflatable chairs. A swing.

‘We have more space to expand into in the area behind the master grid. That’s where the gym is going. Your interview is in the cube. It’s the one totally private meeting space we have.’

She veered right and cut a path between two workstation clusters and several more employees, in the direction of a large glass box in the middle of the office floor. It was about the size of a shipping container, framed by more bare metal girders. The walls were made up of large sheets of glass, untinted this time, lined on the inside with white slatted privacy blinds. All of the blinds were closed.

I raised a hand to cover my mouth and stifle the dry cough I get when I’m nervous. My palms were damp and I wiped them surreptitiously on my skirt.

Then stopped.

A man in a fitted white shirt and slim, dark tie had opened the door to the cube and stepped out. He was athletic-looking, square-jawed. There was something about him. Something immediately arresting. He was handsome, yes, Hayley had been right about that. But he also had this presence. An intensity. A focus.

On me.

‘Kate Harding?’

I seemed to have lost my voice for a second.

‘Joel White. Why don’t you come on in?’

Joel offered Kate his hand. As they touched, it felt to him as if a small jolt passed between them, like a tiny electric charge. Did she feel it, too?

She didn’t appear to, but he did notice that her palm was greasy and he could tell she was embarrassed by it as she slipped her hand free, and he gestured for her to move past him into the cube.

He watched her, and for a curious second he was lost – his hearing warped, a sour taste pooling on his tongue – until everything snapped back again and his focus returned.

Pay attention now.

She hesitated when she was inside, acting skittishly as she scanned the interior to get her bearings. Not that there was much for her to see.

A glass desk with two matching white leather office chairs on either side of it. Track lighting above them. The closed shutter blinds.

The austere environment was deliberate and something Joel had specified. He preferred to minimize signal interference wherever he could.

‘I’m sorry to get you here so late on a Friday,’ he said now. ‘Hayley, can you take care of Kate’s bag?’

‘Oh no, that’s OK.’ Kate flinched and clasped it against her. ‘I’ll keep it with me if that’s all right?’

‘Of course. No problem, Kate. Can we offer you coffee or tea?’

‘Water is fine.’

She motioned to the carafe that was on one side of the glass desk, next to two highball tumblers. At the other side of the desk was a telephone. The leather folio case was in the middle, and that was it.

‘Anything else?’

‘I don’t think so.’

‘Then we’re all set. Thank you, Hayley. You can close the door on your way out.’

The door closed behind them with a well-greased click. In the short silence that followed, Joel felt the air in the room pressing against his skin, his instincts sharpening, his eyes fixed on Kate.

‘Sit down, Kate. Please. Make yourself comfortable.’

He moved around behind the desk, waiting for her to take the seat opposite him. She placed her bag on the floor to her right, straightened her skirt, and once she was settled he pressed his tie flat against his torso and dropped into his own chair.

‘I apologize for keeping you waiting, Kate. It wasn’t my intention. I’m afraid it’s been a packed day.’

‘It’s fine. It gave me an opportunity to get a feel for the building.’

‘Do you like it?’

‘Very much.’

He nodded, smiling warmly, keen to put her at her ease. Experience had taught him to keep the early interactions simple. Establish a rapport. Build a foundation of trust. Using Kate’s name repeatedly was a technique designed to reassure her. So was taking his time and not hurrying her in any way.

Joel’s main purpose right now was to watch her, study her, see how she behaved. Did she blink frequently? Did she raise her eyebrows or move her hands when she talked? If she moved her hands, what did she do with them? Did she clasp them together? What about touching her face or her hair? Then there was smiling. How much did she smile? How readily? Did she frown when she was thinking of an answer? Did her pupils contract or dilate? Was there a flicker in her upper lip or her cheek? What were her tells?

Back in his formative days with the intelligence services, interviewing witnesses and suspects, spies and informants, Joel had come to think of this stage of his process like the control questions a technician might employ when calibrating a lie detector machine. The difference was he believed he was more intuitive and ultimately more accurate than any machine, anywhere in the world. As did the clients who paid him so handsomely.

‘So, Kate. I’m guessing working in an office tower isn’t going to be an issue for a former flight attendant like you?’

There. Relaxation. A slight softening of her lips. A small downward hook at the corners of her eyes.

‘That was some years ago now,’ she said, ‘but I think I should be able to handle any altitude sickness.’

He chuckled, nodding in appreciation and encouragement, noting how the smile became crooked, registering a self-effacing shrug.

Anything else? No.

‘So listen, I know you were originally scheduled to be interviewed by Amanda . . .’ Tension again. The chin tilted up. The brow crinkled. ‘. . . and I’m sorry that didn’t work out, but hopefully you were told I was stepping in for her in good time?’

Her pupils jinked left to right very rapidly. She tucked her hair behind her ear and winced.

‘Actually, I wasn’t.’

‘Oh?’

‘To be honest, I only found out when Hayley mentioned your name just now.’

A stirring in his blood. Normally the phrase ‘to be honest’ was a red flag for Joel. When a subject used it, it was generally because they were about to be anything but honest. But Joel knew for a fact that wasn’t the case here – because he’d made certain she wouldn’t be told – and it was something he’d have to log and remember.

‘Well, that definitely shouldn’t have happened. I’m embarrassed, Kate. For myself, and for Edge. You must feel you’ve been thrown for a loop.’

‘It’s fine. Really.’

She flapped her hand. Puffed out her lips. Over-compensating.

‘No, it’s not fine. Not by a long way. I want you to know that I’m on your side here, Kate. I want you to do well. And in that spirit, please don’t worry that you won’t have had a chance to learn anything about me. I’ll introduce myself to you from scratch and we’ll go from there. Does that sound fair?’

‘It does. Thank you.’

‘Good. So I suppose the first thing to say is that I’m new to Edge myself, working out of our New York office. My background is in recruitment although in recent years I’ve also branched out into corporate troubleshooting and crisis management, working all over the world. But I like to think my real specialism is in meeting people like you one-on-one. Interviewing them. Getting to know what makes them tick.’

He knitted his hands together, tipped his head to one side, smiling freely again. Some of what he’d said was even true, though not the part about having come from the States. He’d never set foot in the offices of Edge in New York. He’d actually flown in from Shanghai, under a different name with different documentation. Prior to that he’d been in Hong Kong. A similar assignment. Another interview in a long sequence of interviews. In Hong Kong, a junior employee had been suspected of corporate espionage. Wrongly, as it turned out. In Shanghai, a female executive had confessed to an affair with a senior board member’s wife. It wasn’t the secret she’d been accused of hiding, but despite his employer’s obvious embarrassment at the revelation, he’d still been paid.

Now he tapped his thumbs together, smiling placidly, and this time Kate held his gaze and remained steady as he allowed the moment to lengthen and stretch. He liked that about her. It meant he would know when the cracks began to show.

‘So . . .’ He reached for the glass tumblers, turning them upright and pouring water into them from the carafe. ‘I have a copy of your CV.’

Friday 5.25 p.m.


I nodded, trying to keep up. It was weird. I was concentrating so hard on being present in the moment that it was making everything feel hyper-real – almost unreal – as if the interview itself was passing me by.

It didn’t help that I kept looping on how badly my palm had squelched in Joel’s hand when we’d shaken. And great. Now I was sweating under my arms, too. I shifted position, adjusted my blouse.

Did he notice? I didn’t think so. And anyway, based on how polite and courteous he was, it wasn’t as if he’d let me know it if he did.

Right now his gaze was downcast as he opened the leather folio in front of him. I craned my neck slightly and glimpsed my CV at the top. The paper was crinkled. A few parts had been underlined. One of them was the bit about swimming.

Ugh.

There was also an inch or so of paperwork underneath my CV. The other candidates’ applications, I supposed. I got a sinking feeling as I thought about how many other people were vying with me for this position and how much I now wanted it. Joel had probably been just as charming and considerate to them all.

Then he looked up at me and it was as though every single thought I’d been having fell out of my head. He had flat grey eyes, like tiny dulled mirrors, and again, there was something compelling about the way he was studying me with them. I hadn’t been stared at so openly in a very long time.

For a second, a crazy thought flashed in my mind. Was he . . . flirting with me?

And then another, even odder thought: did I mind?

His jaw was square, his brow prominent, his dark hair graded short, like his stubble. His shirtsleeves were rolled up on his muscular forearms, the cuffs neatly buttoned, his tie held in place by a silver tiepin. I could smell a faint trace of his cologne. Notes of cedarwood and citrus. For a jolting second, I thought I recognized the scent, but then, almost as soon as I’d noticed, it was gone.

‘Your CV is brief and to the point, Kate, but from your background you seem to be an excellent fit for this role.’

‘Thank you. I was advised to keep my CV short so that we’d have more to talk about. But I know that my recruitment agent spoke at length with Amanda about my background.’

Oh God. The slight vocal fry in my voice. I was fighting hard to keep my nerves in check but it was a difficult thing to do in the intense hush of the cube. Hayley had been right when she’d told me the space was private. All the noise and hubbub of the office floor had been muted. I couldn’t see out through the closed blinds and I was pretty sure the forced intimacy of the set-up was contributing to my spaced feeling.

‘Can I level with you, Kate?’

Again, I got the sinking feeling. Had the position already been filled? I really hoped not, but I also knew there was a chance he could have settled on a candidate already. If he’d flown in from the States, he was probably jet-lagged. Perhaps he just wanted this over.

He leaned closer. ‘I probably shouldn’t be saying this, but I’ve had a full day of interviewing candidates in here and I’ve got to tell you, this whole set-up is starting to feel pretty artificial to me.’

Well, at least I’m not the only one.

He cast his hands around. No wedding ring, I was ashamed to have noticed.

‘Think about it too much and you start to go mad. I’m a professional recruiter so I know the routine. I ask you the type of questions you’re expecting me to ask, and you give me the type of answers I’m expecting you to give, and then I’m required to make a judgement on you, when the fact is I don’t know the real you at all.’

‘Well, if it helps, I’m going to answer all your questions as honestly as I can.’

Actually, that was a lie. I was going to try and answer them in line with the advice in the book I had stuffed in my handbag. Interview SOS: 101 Job Interview Questions and How to Answer Them. The pages of my copy were flagged with sticky notes and blocks of text picked out in highlighter pen. I’d been up late the past three nights studying it cover to cover. When Simon and Rebecca had interviewed me, it had been more of a casual chat – mainly because a friend of my brother’s, a consultant he worked with, had put in a good word for me. It was years now since I’d been formally interviewed. The last time had been in front of a trio of senior executives before I was promoted to PR Account Manager at MarshJet.

‘You know something, Kate? I read this article a while ago – I forget where – but it was all about the science behind first impressions. You’ll have heard the same thing, right? The theory goes that we all make hard-to-shake judgements about other people within the first few seconds of meeting them. The way they look. The way they act and present themselves. The first handshake. First hello. We take all that data in, and we crunch it incredibly fast, and we already know, on an instinctive level, how we feel about someone before we even talk to them.’

‘Right.’ I teetered. ‘Then do I get the job?’

He rocked back and laughed, harder than he needed to. ‘I wish it could be so easy. Believe me. But we both have to jump through the hoops here, Kate. I’m guessing you already know Edge do things a little differently?’

‘It’s why I’m here.’

‘Well, sometimes when we’re hiring, we like to use psychometric tests. Other similar techniques. For the right candidates.’ He flipped over my CV and removed a clear plastic pocket from the folio case, sliding it across the desk in front of me. I could see several sheets of typed paperwork inside. ‘What do you say? Would you be prepared to go along with that?’

I thought of the warnings Maggie had given me. I hadn’t been told this was part of the recruitment process here and I’d never taken a psychometric test before. I didn’t, in all honesty, know what they really involved. But I felt comfortable with Joel. I was inclined to follow his lead. And more importantly, I’d picked up on two crucial things he’d said. Sometimes when we’re hiring. Sometimes. Not every time. And also: For the right candidates.

‘I can do that, yes.’

‘Great.’ He dipped two fingers into his shirt pocket and removed a propeller pencil that he clicked a couple of times. ‘How about you get started?’

Friday 5.30 p.m.


‘Now?’ I asked.

‘It’s only a short test, Kate. Won’t take you more than ten minutes to complete. We’ll have plenty of time to talk afterwards, I promise.’

He passed me the pencil.

‘Should I step outside?’

‘No, there’s no need for that. We can both stay here.’

I looked at him, puzzled.

‘Relax, Kate. I designed these questions myself. It’s completely painless and you won’t have any trouble with them.’

I opened the plastic pocket and slipped the papers out from inside. They were neatly stapled and there were only five or six pages. I was conscious of Joel watching me as I flicked through them before looking up.

‘Can I ask you something?’

‘By all means.’

‘What is it you’re hoping this will show you?’

‘You, Kate.’ He spread his hands and grinned as though I’d asked him the exact question he’d hoped I might. ‘Specifically, your personality traits. The best approach is not to think of this as a test at all. It isn’t anything you can fail. It’s more like a questionnaire. The idea is for me to get a truer sense of who you are, to see whether you’d be a good fit for the company and more importantly, if the company is a good fit for you.’

‘And if we’re not a good fit?’

He smiled again. ‘Why don’t you just go ahead and take the test and we’ll see. And be sure to answer honestly, for both our sakes.’

I glanced down at the top sheet of paper.

1. I don’t like confrontation and avoid it where possible.

(a) This is not like me (b) This is sometimes like me

(c) This is often like me (d) This is very like me

2. I prefer working on my own rather than as part of a team.

(a) This is not like me (b) This is sometimes like me

(c) This is often like me (d) This is very like me

3. I make decisions quickly and stick to them.

(a) This is not like me (b) This is sometimes like me

(c) This is often like me (d) This is very like me

I lowered the pencil towards the paper, then stopped and looked up again. ‘What if I’m not sure what to put?’

‘Go with your gut.’

‘But with some of these questions, it really depends on the circumstances, don’t you think?’

‘Make your best judgement, Kate. Trust yourself.’

1. I don’t like confrontation and avoid it where possible.

Well, that didn’t seem so hard. You’d have to be a complete psycho to like confrontation, but equally I could see that it wouldn’t do me much good to say that I actively avoided it. Edge would want their applicants to be prepared to speak up when they disagreed or were challenged on something. I circled (b) This is sometimes like me.

I moved on and stuck with answer (b) to question two (I prefer working on my own rather than as part of a team). For question three (I make decisions quickly and stick to them) I went with (c) This is often like me.

After that, I began moving more swiftly through the questions. Joel was right. Even though having him watch me felt a bit awkward, they really didn’t take too much thought. Besides, I could hardly go wrong if I mixed my answers up between (b) and (c) all the way through.

Unless . . .

I pressed down on the pencil, almost breaking the lead. I was thinking about what I knew about Edge. They liked to stand out, do things differently. Did that mean they were actively seeking employees who tended towards one extreme or the other? Perhaps it was a mistake not to be circling the (a) or (d) options.

‘Kate?’

I lifted my eyes and he shook his head gently.

‘Stop thinking about what you think we want to hear and tick what is right for you.’

What was he, a mind reader?

‘It’s just that—’

‘It’s OK, Kate. Really. Everyone does it.’

‘Everyone?’

‘Almost everyone.’

Was that a hint? I looked down at the next question.

10. Speaking in public makes me nervous.

I stared so hard at the words they swam before my eyes. My skin flushed hot and I immediately worried he could tell, which only intensified the sensation. There was that one time – the one that would never go away now – but it was something I knew I had to push past. And the real me – the one I’d told my counsellor I was afraid I’d lost touch with – had always been naturally talkative. You couldn’t be an effective PR if you weren’t a confident spokesperson. I circled (a) This is not like me.

‘Good, Kate.’

I blocked the bad thoughts that were crowding in on me, the sense that I was cheating in some way, and tried not to squirm. Staying still seemed suddenly important because I was starting to wonder if Joel was just as interested in how I approached the test as the answers I circled. Now that I thought of it, perhaps that was why he’d wanted to stay inside the room with me.

I pushed on, trying to convey a sense of confidence even if that wasn’t really how I was feeling. Soon, I became so absorbed that I almost forgot Joel was there and the next two pages of questions passed in something of a blur.

Until I turned to the penultimate page and read the question at the top.

26. When I am having sex I picture myself with other partners.

Whoa.

‰?Problem?’ Joel asked me.

I showed him the page, pointing to the question.

‘Ah, yes.’ He scrunched his face up. ‘Question twenty-six.’

‘It’s intrusive.’

‘You’re right, Kate. I apologize.’

‘Not to mention highly personal.’

‘I agree with you.’

‘I’m not going to answer it.’

He sucked air through his teeth and looked pained. I took the gesture as an indication that I was making a mistake.

‘This question shouldn’t be on here,’ I told him. ‘It’s not right.’

His wince became more regretful. ‘Yet I put it there.’

‘It breaches all kinds of employment laws and . . .’

His eyebrows shot up, like I’d struck the nail on the head.

And then it hit me. The Edge mantra. Break your own rules.

‘Why don’t you remind me what you answered for question one, Kate?’

I stilled for a second, aware of a buzzing across my scalp as he watched me flip back to the start of the test.

1. I don’t like confrontation and avoid it where possible.

I’d answered (b) This is sometimes like me. But that didn’t really mean anything. Did it?

‘If it helps at all, these questionnaires are strictly confidential, Kate. Perhaps I should have mentioned that at the beginning.’

I flipped back to the sex question. I felt embarrassed by it, exposed. But at the same time . . .

‘You’re going to read it,’ I told him.

‘Because that’s my role here.’

‘Would you answer this question?’

He seemed to think for a moment about what the most diplomatic response could be. ‘I’m not the one applying for a job, Kate.’

And I supposed that was the point, wasn’t it? I wanted to work here, or at least have the option of working here. Maggie had told me again and again what a great opportunity this was for me. I knew she was right. And if this was one of the hoops I was expected to jump through . . .

‘It doesn’t apply to me,’ I said, more quietly this time.

Joel faltered, as if he wasn’t sure how to respond to that, but then before he could settle on something to say, I shook my head and circled (a) This is not like me.

The questions that followed were equally crass and bizarre.

27. Recreational drugs help me to relax.

28. I have been violent on occasion.

29. I discriminate against others based on their ethnicity or religion.

I kept my head down and circled (a) This is not like me to them all. I thought I had a handle on what was going on now. It seemed to me that Joel was seeking to provoke a response. Perhaps some candidates would flatly refuse to answer his questions whereas others might just blindly tick their responses without querying the test at all. But the way he’d interacted with me, responding to how I’d challenged him, told me those would have been the wrong moves to make. I also suspected this was the main reason why he’d wanted me to fill out the questionnaire in his presence and I began to feel a growing confidence about how I’d handled things.

On the final page there was one last question.

30. I view psychometric tests as a waste of my time.

I laughed faintly, shaking my head.

‘Can’t say I’m not intrigued by what you’re going to answer to this one,’ Joel said.

I smirked, tapping the end of the pencil against my palm to prolong the moment, then again circled (a) This is not like me.

‘Are you sure about that?’ he asked me.

‘I’m sure.’

‘Do you need any more time to look back over any of your answers? Or do you have any other questions or notes you’d like to add?’

‘No. I’m finished.’

I held his gaze as I butted the pages back together and slipped them inside the plastic pocket. After placing the pencil on top, I went to push everything across the surface of the desk towards him when he raised a hand and stopped me.

‘No, that’s OK, Kate. You hold on to it for now. Let’s get down to it, shall we? Why don’t you tell me about yourself?’





10


Joel watched Kate’s pupils flick upwards and to the left. Information recall. Here came the prepared response.

‘Well,’ she said, ‘I’ve always been passionate about connecting and communicating with other people. After gaining an Air Cabin Crew Diploma at college, I worked for four years as a flight attendant on international and transatlantic flights. I loved the lifestyle, and it was an exciting and rewarding career, but I realized I wanted to change course and so, after spending three years studying for a communications degree via distance learning, I applied for and secured a training position as a PR assistant with MarshJet. My work focused on promoting their aeroplane manufacturing business across the world, competing with the likes of Boeing and Airbus, and I rose through the ranks to an Account Manager role. Since then I’ve also worked as an Account Manager at Simple PR, growing brands and helping to drive sales for a variety of travel companies. Now I’m looking for a new challenge in a more dynamic, higher profile field, which is why I’m so interested in working as an Elite Account Manager at Edge.’

No surprises there. It was basically a rehash of the statement she’d placed at the beginning of her CV. Again, instead of focusing on what she was saying, Joel took the opportunity to study what she was doing instead.

He logged her eye movements and facial expressions. The pauses she took between speaking. He noticed that she was maintaining eye contact, even as she withdrew her hands, and he sensed it was bothering her that he hadn’t accepted the questionnaire back from her yet.

‘That’s a very detailed answer, Kate. I can see you’ve done your research and preparation.’

He let that hang, careful now to convey just the right impression of being mildly vexed and disappointed by her, as if she’d spoiled the fun they’d been having. Tilting his head to one side, he flipped back to the beginning of her CV in the folio case. The way he responded physically was another tool in his arsenal. He could use his own body language to magnify any message he cared to. Such as when he wanted to throw her off her stride, make her doubt herself.

‘Prepared answer or not, I mean what I say about working for Edge,’ she told him. ‘I think I could make a real impact here.’

Interesting.

When he glanced up, her brow was furrowed, her lower jaw extended. A fighter’s pose. Maybe this would be more of a challenge than he’d thought.

‘You mentioned that you enjoyed being a flight attendant.’

‘I did.’

‘What did you like about it?’

Her eyes went up and to the left again. Another prepared answer, even after he’d signalled it wasn’t a good strategy for her. That was also interesting. It confirmed to him that she was faking what confidence she had.

‘All the things you would expect. I liked to travel. I enjoyed flying. But mostly I enjoyed it for the connections I made with the passengers and my colleagues. It was fun putting a smile on people’s faces.’

‘And the discount travel?’

‘That helped. We had a similar scheme at MarshJet. It’s one of the perks that comes from working for a company that supplies passenger planes to many of the world’s leading airlines.’

‘You miss it?’

‘Sometimes I do.’ There. Her eyes went misty, as if she was looking inwards. It was a classic indicator of an honest, instinctive response. ‘I miss being in the air. I miss the sensation of take-off and the thrill I got from seeing people reach their destinations. Mostly I worked long haul, and often the people flying with us were taking their one holiday of the year, or travelling to catch up with family. I liked being part of that.’

‘Were you ever scared?’

Hesitation.

‘No.’

A lie.

An obvious one. He felt a small pulsing behind his thorax, like the throb from an invisible pacemaker.

‘Any near misses? Emergency landings? Technical faults?’

She bit her cheek and he saw how the colour instantly drained from her face. She was naturally pale and there was a blue tincture of veins curled up at her temple. If he watched closely, he was pretty sure he could see when her pulse spiked.

‘No.’ Her voice quavered. ‘I was lucky.’

‘Speaking of MarshJet, I don’t know if you happened to catch the news today, but they were saying—’

‘I saw it.’ Her eyelids flipped down. Her mouth closed. A trap slamming shut.

Joel felt another hot buzz in the middle of his chest. He could have let the sensation spread, but he dampened it down. Controlled himself.

‘Needless to say, I’m as interested as anyone else in seeing how the court trial turns out.’

Now she lifted her chin, straightened her shoulders. A classic reset position. He could see she wanted him to move on. So he did. Momentarily.

‘Why the change to PR in the first place, Kate?’

Light bloomed in her pupils, as if she thought she’d made it back to safe ground. ‘I think it was really the creative side of PR that appealed to me. Plus I love to organize things. I’m good at keeping on top of projects, sticking to budgets.’

‘And by working at MarshJet you continued to work in the airline industry. It was a logical move.’

He dropped his gaze and watched through the glass surface of the desk as she pulled her hands in towards her waist. A defensive impulse. She was picking at her thumbnail, too.

Good. There was definitely something there.

‘Yes, it was logical. They were looking for someone who could talk the language of flying with clients and journalists without geeking out. Several of my colleagues were former flight crew, too.’

‘Tell me about some of the campaigns you worked on.’

‘The most high-profile campaign I helped to develop and implement surrounded the launch of our CruiseFlyer super jumbo. At the time it was the world’s largest, most fuel-efficient passenger plane. I helped to secure global coverage in the trade and general press.’

‘What else?’

‘I was heavily involved in helping to promote our existing fleet of mid-sized passenger jets to a number of European airlines. I also spearheaded a campaign to highlight MarshJet’s green credentials.’

A hanging pause.

‘And the cabin air scandal? What was your involvement in that?’

She raised her chin, the tangle of blue veins pressing against her skin.

‘I did my job. We had evidence demonstrating that our planes were safe and I was part of the team that communicated that. As I said, I’m aware of the ongoing court case, but it’s really not something I’m in a position to comment on.’

Friday 5.47 p.m.


My temples were pounding. I could feel a clammy coolness at the back of my neck. Somehow things had started to go wrong. Joel’s attitude towards me had changed. Or maybe it was me? Perhaps Joel had picked up on my discomfort, amplified it back to me.

It was always going to be tricky for me to talk about my time at MarshJet, but I’d tried to handle things the best way I could. I hadn’t evaded Joel’s questions, but I had made it clear the court case wasn’t something I wanted to discuss.

Not that I didn’t get why he would be interested. I also understood that perhaps he thought I could give him an inside track.

For most of the past week, the press had been running stories about how the family of a former flight attendant named Melanie Turner were suing her ex-airline employers, alongside MarshJet, in the High Court in London, in a test case backed by the unions that represented pilots and cabin crew.

Before her death, Melanie had suffered from acute joint pains, headaches and cognitive degeneration that her family believed had been caused by regularly breathing contaminated cabin air. As with other aeroplane manufacturers, the systems on board MarshJet planes used compressed air taken from aircraft engines to maintain cabin pressure. Melanie’s family, and the unions backing them, argued that this recycled air contained poisonous fumes, and that long-term exposure to it on MarshJet’s planes had caused Melanie’s illnesses – as well as the acute health problems suffered by hundreds of other pilots and crew.

Whether or not the claims could be proven in court, the personal tragedy that Melanie’s family had endured (and my heart went out to them) wasn’t something I wanted to dwell on or speculate about, least of all in a job interview. I hoped that was something Joel could respect. It was definitely something I wanted to move on from.

‘What do you say we go for a speed round, Kate? A few more general questions.’

I shifted in my seat. ‘OK.’

‘Where do you hope to be in five years from now?’

A dose of endorphins shot through me and, for a brief moment, I relaxed. For a company that was so hot on innovation, the question was surprisingly mundane. But then my doubts swept back in. Wasn’t the question a bit too mundane? Even though Joel was still watching me closely, I had the worrying sense that he’d mentally checked out, as if his mind was on other things again.

‘For now, I’m keen to develop my expertise, maximize my media contacts and share best practice by managing a team in a forward-thinking, progressive agency with global reach. In five years, I’d like to think that I’ll have proved myself worthy of further progression, perhaps to a role as an Account Director.’

And . . . breathe.

‘I’m glad you didn’t tell me you’d like to be sitting on my side of the desk, Kate. What do you think is your greatest strength?’

‘My curiosity. I like meeting new people, learning new things, having new experiences and facing new challenges. It’s that drive that has brought me here today.’

‘Greatest weakness?’

‘As you know, my experience to date has been focused on the travel industry, and while I’m applying for a role here as an Elite Account Manager focused on the travel brands you represent, down the line I’d love to explore working in connected areas. I think new experiences and fresh challenges can only make me a better publicist and I can’t think of anywhere better for me to spread my wings than at Edge.’

He stared at me without moving. ‘And how about personally?’

‘I drink too much caffeine.’

That seemed like a safe response. It was an answer that didn’t really mean anything. The kind of fun response Joel had seemed to respond to before. Except that now he was peering at me as if maybe it did mean something.

‘Yet you said no to tea or coffee when I offered it to you earlier?’

‘That’s because right now I’m working on improving myself.’

I reached for my glass of water and took a sip as if to cement the point. I wanted to distract him, get him to change tack, but instead he steepled his fingers and leaned forwards over the desk towards me, looking much more serious all of a sudden.

‘I won’t lie to you, Kate. Edge are without question the best at what we do. We work for some of the biggest firms and the wealthiest clients in the world. I think we can both acknowledge this would be a big step up for you, although there’s no reason why that can’t be a good thing. The point I’m trying to make is that in order to be the best, we have to hire the best and work with the best. Right now, we have a role to fill and we’ve been searching for the perfect candidate. I think you may be that candidate. So perhaps now is the time to cast aside all the nonsense we could waste time on and focus on the only thing that really matters here: what is it that’s so special about you?’

Joel maintained his intensity as Kate set her glass down. She looked perturbed, as if she no longer had any idea what to make of him, which was exactly what he wanted.

‘I think that’s a difficult question for me to answer without sounding like an egomaniac,’ she said carefully.

‘Right now isn’t the time to be coy, Kate.’

‘OK.’ She nodded, gathering herself. ‘Then I would say that I’m dedicated. I work hard. I come up with innovative ideas and I always push them as far as I can. At Simple, I’ve worked with our clients at identifying product placement opportunities and fresh social media campaigns that have led to significantly increased levels of business. With bigger brands, household names, I believe I could achieve great results at Edge.’

He watched her without responding, letting the pause go on so long he could tell she was debating whether to fill it or not. The pattern in her answers was blindingly obvious to him now. He’d been able to tell from the very beginning that she’d read one of those corny books on interview technique. She’d been concise. She’d given an example of something she’d achieved. She’d brought it back to Edge.

This time, when he leaned backwards, he scrubbed a hand over his face and took a prolonged glance at his watch. Time to crank things up a notch.

‘What skills do you think a good publicist needs, Kate?’

‘Enthusiasm. Commitment. I think you have to be a very organized person. You need to be able to think strategically. You also need resilience. And creativity, as I’ve mentioned.’

‘What else?’

‘Um . . .?’

‘Do you think you have to be a good liar, for instance?’

‘A liar?’

‘Yes.’

‘I . . . No, I think you have to be able to convey a level of enthusiasm for a product or a client you don’t always feel, but—’

‘Lying, in other words.’

His gaze bored into her. Her lips moved and he could see she was reckoning with how to respond, but he pressed on before she could.

‘What’s your opinion of Hayley?’

‘Hayley . . .?’

‘She brought you in here. You don’t remember her?’

‘No, of course I do. It’s just that—’

‘Just what, Kate?’

He saw the flash of disquiet in her eyes. She obviously understood this wasn’t something he should be asking her. After a moment’s consideration, she sat up a little straighter, raised her chin.

‘She seems nice.’

‘Does she?’

‘I think so, yes.’

‘And is “nice” all you think?’

‘Well . . . I’ve only just met her, obviously. But I’m sure she’s very good at her job.’

‘You are? Why?’

‘Because she struck me that way. You mentioned first impressions and that was my first impression of Hayley. She seemed confident in what she was doing. Relaxed. At ease.’

He drummed his thumbs against the edge of the desk, allowing more silence to develop. Did she realize that everything she’d just said was the exact opposite of the behaviour she was displaying right now? From the way she was shifting in her chair, rubbing her hands on her thighs, he was pretty sure she did. And now she glanced over her shoulder towards the door as if she was scoping out her exit.

‘Why don’t you tell me what you make of this place, Kate? The office layout. The pods. The refectory. All that. Your first impressions.’

‘It’s impressive.’

‘Impressive. OK. You don’t think it’s . . . I don’t know. Ridiculous?’

Again, she glanced towards the door. This time, she noticed that he’d caught her doing it and she tried to cover it up, straightening her shoulders, smoothing her hands across her skirt.

‘Do you think it’s ridiculous?’ she asked him, raising an eyebrow.

‘I’m asking you, Kate. I’m inviting your opinion.’

‘The truth?’

‘That’s what I’m here for.’

Somewhere in the universe, there was a distant ringing clang.

‘OK. Then I think it’s an aesthetic. I think it tells your staff and anybody else who walks in here exactly what Edge is about.’

‘And what is that, would you say?’

‘That you’re energetic. That you’re unconventional. Fun.’

‘You don’t think it looks like we’re wasting time?’

‘That would be impossible for me to say without spending more time here. But my guess is that in any given week most of the game-type stuff doesn’t get used very often.’

‘It’s all for show then?’

‘Doesn’t matter if it is. It still serves a purpose.’

‘Does it strike you as sinister at all?’

She hesitated, as if perhaps she expected him to backtrack.

‘You don’t know, or you don’t have an opinion?’ he pressed.

‘I’m . . . not really sure I understand what you mean.’

‘Well, what I suppose I mean is that having all these areas to have fun and relax, all this free food, perhaps it’s just a way to trick our staff into working longer hours. Like we don’t want them to leave, maybe.’

‘Is that what you’re doing?’

He sighed and broke eye contact, glancing down at her CV again.

‘Do you worry about your age, Kate?’

Friday 5.58 p.m.


‘Excuse me?’

I was reeling. How had things got so off track? I’d felt as if there was a real connection between us to begin with. Now I seemed to be under attack.

‘I’m asking if you think you’re too old for the role, Kate. Most of the staff you passed on your way in here today are already Account Managers or Elite Account Managers with us. By the time they’re your age, they’ll be looking for promotions, or moving on to start their own boutique firms, maybe thinking of starting families.’

For a second, I could almost picture Mark watching from the corner of the room. I could imagine him stepping forward to interject and shield me, tell Joel he was out of line.

‘I’m . . .’ Challenge him? Let it go? ‘I’m not sure that’s an appropriate question.’

‘Oh, it’s not. Clearly.’ He parted his hands. ‘But it is something I’m inevitably going to weigh up when I consider if I should offer you this job, whether I choose to admit it to you or not. Personally, for what it’s worth, I don’t think your age is anything you need to worry about. So you’re female and thirty-one. You could be twenty-five, and what’s the big difference? I suppose the question is, has it become a hang-up for you?’

Actually, I was starting to think a better question was, should I punch him in the nose or the mouth?

I knew I had a choice now. I could take clear offence at his sexist attitude and needling questions. Or I could treat it as harmless conjecture, play along, try to recreate the flirty rapport we’d traded earlier.

‘You’re beginning to sound like you think you’re my therapist.’

‘Do you have a therapist, Kate?’

So I wasn’t imagining it. This was targeted. It was deliberate. Not unlike some of the more out-there questions on the psychometric test, I wondered if it was a tactic that was designed to push me off balance, see how I reacted.

‘If I did have a therapist, it wouldn’t be any of your business.’

‘No?’

‘Definitely not.’

‘OK.’ He rolled out his bottom lip, bobbed his head. ‘This company you work for at the moment. Simple PR. Do they know you’re here today?’

‘I took the day off.’

‘But see, that’s not answering my question, Kate.’

Arsehole.

‘Then, no. I didn’t tell them directly.’

‘So just to get this straight, what you’re saying is they don’t know you’re here today. You’re lying to them.’

This again.

‘I’m . . . They’ve been good to me. They’re a small firm and when I decided to move on from MarshJet, they basically created a role for me. I didn’t want to upset them by telling them I was interviewing for another position unless—’

‘Unless you get the job. I understand. But your omission is a type of lie, isn’t it? You must be able to see that. They think you have a day off. They probably think you’re running errands, or maybe you’ve gone away for the weekend, or—’

‘I told them I’m having a spa day.’

‘A spa day?’

‘I told them I had to use up a voucher my brother had given me for my birthday. Which I do, as it happens.’

‘Except not today. Because today you’re here. With me.’

Me. I didn’t like that. His focus should be on Edge.

There was something different about his smile now, too. Something almost taunting. His eyes seemed oddly disconnected from it, but deliberately so, as if he wanted me to see how insincere he was being. I sensed again that he was trying to needle me. That there was another agenda here he was working towards.

‘Suppose I call them, Kate.’ He nodded towards the telephone. ‘Suppose I pick up that phone right now and call them and tell them you’re here with me. How do you think they would feel about that?’

I instinctively tightened my hands around the arms of my chair, wondering for a second if I should treat it as a rhetorical question. But then I thought once more of the pep talk Maggie had given me. I’d told him a good PR had to be resilient.

Prove it.

‘I’m sure they wouldn’t be happy about it.’

‘Because?’

He watched me again. Those eyes. I could feel them scrabbling over my skin.

‘Because they rely on me.’

‘And because you lied to them.’

‘No. It’s not like that. I—’

‘Who does know you’re here today?’





14


‘No one,’ she said. ‘Other than my recruitment agent.’

Joel’s blood was up. He could feel it thrumming through his veins. That burning again, mixed in with the buzzing in his chest. He was so dialled in to her now that he could tell it was another lie immediately.

But an unusual one. He had to give her that.

She didn’t look up or look down. She didn’t fidget, or swallow. She held herself preternaturally still. It was only in the vaguest twitching of her cheek and the very depths of her pupils that he caught the slightest hint of a tell.

She was good. Better than average, anyway. Joel had dealt with countless CEOs and board members who would have blown up at him by now. There was that one management candidate in Tokyo he’d never forget – the one who got so distressed when Joel challenged him about embellishing sales figures that he began weeping and tearing at his clothes, ripping his shirt clean open in a desperate act of corporate self-flagellation.

‘Really?’ he said. ‘You’ve told me how badly you want this job, Kate. You’ve talked many times about how excited you are to work at Edge. And yet you’re telling me you weren’t excited enough to tell anyone close to you about this interview?’

He watched her lips press together as she pondered her next move. Would she admit to the lie, or double down on it?

‘You seem flustered, Kate.’

‘I suppose I’m just wondering what this all has to do with my ability to do the job I’m here to interview for.’

Deflection. Also interesting.

He felt a wave of heat move through him as he lowered his eyes to the folio case again, tracing his finger down over her CV. The lie about swimming was an obvious and depressingly common one, but he no longer felt the need to go there. Rather, he allowed the silence to develop for so long that she opted to fill it.

‘Perhaps you could tell me something more about the details of the role I’d be doing here at Edge. If I was offered the job, I mean.’

‘No, right now I’d much rather you told me about this gap on your CV, Kate.’

‘I don’t—’

‘There’s a gap on your CV, Kate. You started working for this agency, Simple, nine months ago. You stopped working at MarshJet six months before that. Now, my maths isn’t brilliant, but even I can see that there’s a gap.’

Silence.

She stared at him. The wave of heat pulsed outwards towards his extremities as he saw the muscles in her jaw bunch and tighten. Again, her gaze flicked to the door. A kind of desperation in it now.

‘It’s OK if you quit and it took you a while to land a new job, Kate. Or perhaps it wasn’t your decision to leave MarshJet in the first place. You’d been with them, what, almost seven years? Maybe they – you know.’

He made a pushing gesture with the heel of his hand. A squawking noise in his throat.

He noticed that she was physically trembling now. Her lips had thinned, her nostrils were pinched.

‘That wasn’t what happened,’ she shot back, her fingers digging into the arms of her chair.

One more nudge.

‘You sound offended, Kate. I’m not sure why. Maybe you need a refresher on what my role is here today. It’s my responsibility to look at the information you provided to us, and the answers you give me, and identify any areas of possible concern. Which brings us to this gap. The one I noticed. Now, it’s possible you don’t want to talk about it because you’re embarrassed, or ashamed, or because you’re hiding something, or—’

‘That’s enough.’ The wavering pitch of her voice caught them both by surprise. ‘I’ve played your games. But that is enough.’

‘Is it? Shouldn’t I be the judge of that?’

Her eyes were reddening, wet. She bit her cheek and shook her head. A wounded look of hurt and defiance on her face. Of disgust.

‘My husband died,’ she said.

Friday 6.07 p.m.


There. I’d said it.

And it hurt.

Damn him.

Hot tears pricked my eyes. There was a lump in my throat. My nails scraped against the upholstery of my chair.

I wouldn’t cry in front of this man. I refused to cry in front of him.

But the emotion was welling up in me and when it hit like this – especially when I didn’t want it to – it wasn’t anything I could control.

I blinked, taking hold of my wedding ring, rolling it around and around my finger. Mark and I had chosen it together, on a weekend trip to Chicago. It was an inexpensive platinum band but there were so many memories wrapped up in it. A whole future we couldn’t now share.

My eyes stung. I glanced down at my hands as if somehow they could help me to hold everything in.

‘Mark was killed in the Global Air disaster,’ I whispered. ‘He was one of the victims.’

I still couldn’t say the words out loud without wanting to scream. Mark was everything to me and now he was gone. Taken from me in the most harrowing way imaginable. His plane had gone down in the mid-Atlantic, one of 210 passengers who perished.

In the silence that followed, I waited for Joel to apologize. I expected him to act appalled, backtrack, try to repair the damage he’d done.

He did none of those things.

He just watched me without speaking, his eyes like two misted pools, no hint of contrition on his face.

That’s when my anger really kicked in, hot and fast. It was the same futile rage that had engulfed me again and again since the tragedy.

I couldn’t believe I’d been made to feel this way during a job interview. I should never have been put in this position.

I looked up towards the corner of the room, blinking. I bit the insides of my mouth until it stung. To think, I’d actually wanted this job. I’d wanted it for all the reasons it was going to be so hard for me to take. A radically different environment. A complete change. Moving on. But I didn’t want it enough to be poked and prodded and turned inside out for someone else’s entertainment.

‘Forgive me, Kate.’

Something in the way he said it – the detached quality of his voice – told me he didn’t really mean it. Not even close.

I glared at him.

It was too little, too late anyway.

Keep your dignity. You still have that.

‘That was insensitive of me.’ Again, his words were robotic, lacking any genuine compassion, edging towards contempt. He closed the folio case and lifted it from the desk. ‘Kate, I’m going to step out for a moment, get some paperwork, give you some space.’

My breathing had grown ragged. There was a ringing in my ears. I turned and looked away from him as he stood up from behind the desk and came around to pause beside me.

I could smell his cologne again. Was that the scent Mark had worn?

My head swam. I choked back tears.

Then his hand reached out suddenly and for an awful second I thought he was going to touch me, until he swerved at the last moment and lifted the plastic folder containing my answers to the psychometric test.

‘Drink some water if you need to, Kate. I won’t be long.’





16


Fifteen months ago


‘Have a drink of water, Kate. Take your time.’

Time was the last thing I needed. I craved answers and information. I wanted someone to burst into the room and tell me this was all a horrible mistake.

Staring at the water in the glass in front of me, I tried to shut out everything else. My body felt rigid with terror and shock, my heart swollen painfully. My hand was clutching my mobile phone so tightly I could hear the plastic creak.

‘This can’t be happening,’ I murmured.

‘We were only notified moments ago, Kate. There’s nothing in the media yet and the information we have from the airline is sketchy, at best. There could be other explanations, but with Mark and the others on that flight we called you in here as soon as we heard.’

I nodded vaguely, tears quivering in my eyes. Sir Fergus Marsh, the founder and majority owner of MarshJet, was sitting across his vast teak desk from me. His shirtsleeves were rolled up on his forearms, his tie loosened off. It was quarter to nine in the morning inside the MarshJet headquarters close to Gatwick, but his anguished, red-eyed expression made it look as if it was the middle of the night in a military campaign room.

Mark had been flying home on a late-night flight from New York with five other MarshJet employees. They’d been part of a pitch team sent to make a presentation to an American airline. Three of the team were colleagues of mine from PR.

There was a click to my left and Sir Fergus glanced towards the man who had just set down a phone on a breakout table in the corner of his office. Dominic North, his CFO, was rail-thin and prematurely balding with sunken eyes and a mouth that was pressed into a thin line. He was a withdrawn, taciturn figure, known for watching from the wings while Sir Fergus took the spotlight, but his presence told me how serious things were. In my time at the company, I’d learned that Sir Fergus never made any major decisions without Dominic’s backing – or, as Mark sometimes cynically suggested, his say-so. The expectation among most of us was that when Sir Fergus eventually retired, Dominic would take over.

‘They’re checking radar again,’ he said crisply. ‘Still no contact from the flight deck.’

‘Oh God.’

I crumpled, my body trembling uncontrollably.

Three minutes ago everything had been normal. I’d been sitting at my desk, drinking my first coffee of the day, checking my emails. Then I’d looked up to see Sir Fergus’s assistant, Angela, rushing across the office floor towards me, her face blanched white. She’d handed me a piece of paper that told me Sir Fergus needed to see me. Now.

‘Kate, if you need to go home, we understand,’ he said, smiling his kind, grandfather smile. ‘We can arrange a car. Angela can go with you.’

I blinked. Squeezed my hands tighter.

‘Is there anything we can do? I don’t know, a search operation, or, or . . .’

‘These are all the things we’re looking into. We’ll do everything we can. Dominic has an inside line to the airline and the authorities. We’re going to do our best to keep you up to date with what we find out.’

I unfurled my hand and checked my phone for messages again, for missed calls from Mark. My thumb shook as I tried calling him once more, swiping at my nose, tears streaking down my face.

I looked up, lost, pressing the heel of my hand to the side of my head, my phone diverting hopelessly to voicemail. In the corners of my mind, other images were pressing in. The plane roaring downwards in a fireball, spearing into the ocean, breaking apart.

‘Am I going to see him again?’

‘Kate. This could be nothing. An anomaly. We have to hope for the best.’

‘I can’t . . . I don’t want to go home. Please. I want to stay here. If there’s going to be information coming in, if there’s anything you know, I want to hear it. I have to know.’

Sir Fergus paused and looked with concern towards his CFO. I saw Dominic hold his look, measure it, then nod back.

‘OK, Kate. Stay. But if that’s your decision, and only if you feel capable of helping us, then I’m afraid there’s something I may need to ask from you in return. Right now, you’re the only person in communications we have on site.’

Friday 6.11 p.m.


The soft shunt of the door closing behind Joel snapped me out my reverie, bringing me back to myself. I was sitting alone inside the cube, stunned.

It didn’t feel real. None of this felt real.

Joel had to know he’d crossed a line. Forget Edge’s mantra about breaking rules. I’d spent enough time on their company website to know it was impossible to miss their employee charter. They trumpeted their credentials as an ethical employer. They talked about valuing the needs of their staff. My experience today totally contradicted that. Maybe Joel was only now realizing how much trouble he could be in.

Good.

I was breathing too fast, trying to stop the tears from gushing out. I cradled my forehead. Took some deep breaths.

Control yourself.

The tumbler of water was in front of me. I reached for it shakily, raising it to my lips.

As I stared down into the trembling liquid, I allowed another vision to fill my mind. It was my favourite memory from our honeymoon: Mark cradling me in his arms on a pristine white beach. We were barefoot. Mark’s white linen shirt and tightly curled hair were shifting slightly in the soft sea breeze, his eyes happily crinkled against the sunlight. And the way he stroked my face – always with his thumb, always while cupping my cheek in his palm – soothed me even now.

I should get up. I should walk out of here.

What was stopping me?

Embarrassment, mostly.

In my mind’s eye, I was thinking of all the young staff on the main office floor. I could picture them watching me as I tried to keep it together on my way to the exit, knowing I wasn’t fooling anyone.

I flinched at a sudden, jangling noise inside the room.

The desk telephone had started ringing.

I stared at it, setting my glass down on the desk with a thump, a sudden flare of irritation burning inside me, a hot coal pressing against my breastbone.

He hasn’t even diverted the phone.

Had I ever been a serious candidate?

I glanced quickly at my surroundings. The slatted blinds were still closed. The track lights shone brightly. Nobody was coming in through the door.

The phone continued to ring, and as it did, a new thought struck me, bringing with it a deep tremor of unease.

Sometimes when we’re hiring, we like to use psychometric tests. Other similar techniques.

Maggie had mentioned dummy exercises to me. Hayley had dismissed that on our way up here, but was that what this was? I supposed it was possible this was some crazy, out-there stunt. Perhaps it was designed to break me down and build me back up again. Test my initiative.

Or it could be Joel calling to see if I was OK with him coming back in. But that didn’t really seem to fit with his attitude and demeanour when he’d left me.

Answer it, or don’t answer it?

My breathing was still funny. My throat felt raw and choked. I doubted I would be able to keep my voice steady if I did answer.

The phone rang on.

Then a truly nasty thought occurred to me.

Was it possible Joel had known about Mark all along? Had he been leading me to this point deliberately?

Think about it.

I knew it was standard practice for prospective employers to scan the social media feeds of job candidates. And even a cursory look at my Facebook page would reveal my posts about Mark and my membership of the support group that had been formed by the relatives of those who perished in the Global Air tragedy. I didn’t update my personal feed often. There really wasn’t much about my life nowadays that seemed worth sharing. I visited the Facebook memorial group even less because it hurt too much. But scroll back fifteen months and anyone could see my first, tortured posts after the plane crash, or the handful of maudlin posts on the difficult birthdays and anniversaries that had come since.

I felt wounded. Sickened.

They’re a really great company to work for and we have so much fun.

But this wasn’t fun.

It was cruel and exploitative.

Or perhaps the ringing phone was just a coincidence. Bad timing.

It stopped.

The silence that followed was as thin and whispery as the blood through my veins.

I was finding it difficult to think straight. If this was a test, had I failed it? Did I care?

I bit my lip and thought about Mark again, standing on that perfect white beach. The gentle caress of his thumb on my cheek. What would he say if he really could be here with me now?

And there it was. Simple as anything.

Get up and go.

Walk out with your head held high. Without looking back.

I didn’t need this. Nobody needed this.

There would be other jobs and opportunities.

I rolled back my chair, got to my feet. My hands and feet were buzzing with an excess of adrenaline and nerves. All the blood seemed to have drained out of my head, leaving me weightless, giddy.

I turned and faced the door, then paused.

There was no noise at all from the other side. It was almost too silent.

In a flash of paranoia I pictured Joel sitting on the edge of a workstation facing the door, kicking his legs to and fro, smirking as the team surrounding him started a slow clap when I emerged.

Ridiculous.

Open the door and see for yourself.

But before I could move, the telephone started ringing again.

I tensed.

I could pick it up. If this was some crass, insensitive challenge, I could face it down, tell them just what I thought of their company and then walk out.

But a small voice of doubt murmured inside my head. If this was a test, then maybe I shouldn’t answer the phone. Joel had talked about the leading clients and brands Edge represented. As a company, they’d value discretion and confidentiality. Would answering the phone be perceived as a misstep?

No way to tell.

And no way to win.

So I compromised.

I didn’t answer the phone, but I didn’t open the door to the cube, either.

Instead I raised my hand up beside my face, speared two fingers between the slatted blinds and separated them.

But Joel wasn’t sitting there, waiting for me.

There was nobody out there at all.

Friday 6.16 p.m.


There was no movement. No noise. The ceiling lights were dimmed all across the office floor.

On the workstations in front of me, I could see that most of the desktop computers had been shut down, their monitors greyed out. A few others had the Edge logo displayed.

If I didn’t know better, I could have believed that I’d somehow imagined all the people who’d been here when I’d arrived, the energy and commotion I’d seen. It was gone six now, but it still struck me as odd that the office could have emptied so quickly and so completely.

The desk phone continued ringing behind me. A jagged bleat.

Had everyone left or were they – what? Hiding?

I released the blind and stepped backwards into the cube. I didn’t like this. I definitely didn’t want to be alone in this office with Joel, not after the way he’d treated me.

The phone stopped ringing again but somehow the jangle seemed to echo on inside my heart.

I was going to leave now. I would grab my bag, cross the office floor with my head down and . . .

I stopped.

A groan escaped my lips.

My bag was gone. It wasn’t on the floor next to my chair. Where I’d put it was now just empty space.

I whirled around, but it hadn’t been moved anywhere else. It was definitely missing.

I spun back and snatched at the door handle.

In that split-second, the temperature inside the cube seemed to plunge about ten degrees.

I was staring at my hand. At the door handle that hadn’t moved.

I knew what it meant, of course. I understood right away. There was no way I couldn’t know. But somehow, my brain refused to accept it.

I pulled on the door.

I pushed on it.

It made no difference.

It was locked.

I hadn’t heard a lock engage. There wasn’t even a keyhole.

Why was it locked?

I didn’t let go of the handle yet. Something wouldn’t allow me to let go.

I looked up, then. On instinct. My dimmed reflection stared back at me from the glazed ceiling overhead.

Turning, I gazed over my shoulder towards the soundless telephone, a slow creeping in the base of my skull – a powerful, almost primordial sense of how messed up this all was.

The call must have been intended for me. I didn’t have any doubt about that now.

At last, I released the door handle. I was shaken and I hated how the blinds were closed all around me. I didn’t just feel shut in, I felt hemmed in, blinded.

Crossing to the opposite side of the cube, I parted the blinds and looked out, but all I saw were the same things I’d seen before, more or less. The dimmed ceiling lights. The abandoned workstations. Even the arcade dance machine had been unplugged and was unlit.

Again, I allowed the blinds to close and then I stepped back into the middle of the cube. My fingers brushed up against the edge of the glass desk and I withdrew them as if I’d been scalded.

Now what?

I nudged the chair I’d been sitting on to one side. It rolled on its plastic castors and bumped up against the blinds, making them shiver.

There was a plastic rod next to each blind. A pull cord beside that. Lunging forwards, I yanked on a pull cord and kept pulling, hand over hand as the blind zipped upwards. When it was secure, I opened the next blind along and the next after that.

The three blinds I had opened gave me a view towards the refectory. Again, there was nobody there. The lights above the kitchen units were similarly dimmed. The counter surfaces were clear and wiped down.

Hayley had told me they were all heading out for a birthday celebration. Perhaps they’d left and forgotten about me.

A scratch of trepidation in the middle of my spine – like a match being struck.

Easy, Kate.

On the desk behind me, the phone began to ring again.

A strange kind of foreboding descended on me. A hot, kinetic tremor radiating out from the base of my spine.

I reached my hand out very slowly. The downy hairs on the back of my wrist were raised. When I touched the receiver my hand felt oddly deadened, almost as if it belonged to somebody else.

Answer it quickly. Like ripping off a plaster.

I lifted the receiver from the cradle and raised the receiver to my ear.

There was a small, febrile click.

‰?You took your time, Kate.’

It was Joel.

‘What’s happening?’ I asked. ‘Where is everyone?’

‘They’ve left. It’s the weekend.’

I reached out for the chair next to me for support. My fingers dug into the leather upholstery, compressing the spongy foam beneath.

‘I want to leave now,’ I said, in a voice that seemed to be coming from a very long way off – a place where reasonable, normal requests like mine could be made and granted. ‘I’m not interested in this job any more.’

‘Ah, well that’s a problem, Kate. Because I can’t let you go. Not yet.’

‘Listen, I . . .’ My voice wavered. Control it. ‘Look, I’m telling you I want to leave and you have to let me out. I want my handbag back, too.’

‘Why don’t you sit down, Kate? You look a little shaky. I’m worried that chair is going to roll away from under you.’

He can see me.

I turned, horrified.

But he wasn’t standing behind me on the other side of the glass. He wasn’t anywhere.

There was just the cube I was standing in and the empty office floor that surrounded it.

A click.

Dead air.

I dropped the phone.

Three miles away, inside St Thomas’ Hospital, close to Waterloo Station and Westminster Bridge, Kate’s brother, Luke, was thinking about his sister, wondering how her interview had been, if it was over yet, hoping like crazy it had gone OK. She hadn’t texted him and that worried him. It was difficult to shake his lingering doubts that going for this job had been too big a step, too soon.

Not that he’d said anything to Kate. At least not directly. He hadn’t wanted to upset her or jinx the opportunity. It had been much too long since he’d glimpsed even a flicker of excitement in his little sister’s eyes.

He felt a pang, the same way he always did whenever he thought of how vulnerable Kate had become since Mark had been taken from her. Like many of his patients on the cardiac ward where he’d worked for the past eight years, his sister’s whole life had been ripped apart by one dreadful jolt. Before losing Mark, she’d been so confident. So together. Their parents’ deaths had been a blow, no question, but it had forced them to grow up fast, become self-reliant. It had toughened Kate. Hardened her resolve. Luke had envied her for the way she’d struck out for what she’d really wanted in life, right from the very beginning, as soon as she could. He’d kept every postcard she’d ever sent him from her time as cabin crew, from locations all over the world. He’d taken pride in her career in PR, her promotions and campaign successes. Her life had always seemed so big and colourful to him. It had been painful to watch it become so dreary and small.

He was snapped out of his thoughts by a listless groan from the elderly man lying in the hospital bed in front of him.

‘Mr Pinner?’ Luke placed his hand gently on the man’s arm. ‘Mr Pinner, it’s Luke again. I’m just checking your levels.’

The man in the hospital bed was gaunt and slack-faced. For seventy-six years old, he was in relatively good shape. Except that his heart had abruptly stopped beating the previous day when he’d been coming down his attic stairs.

Afterwards, there was always the delayed shock. The shattering disbelief that something inside you could have failed so suddenly and so completely, mixed in with the haunting memory of the paralysing pain.

‘How are you feeling?’

The rheumy eyes completed a slow creep around Luke’s face without focusing. The mouth gaped but no words came out.

‘The doctor says you can have something to eat now. I’m going to see if I can rustle you up some soup. Rest up, OK? I’ll be back in a little while.’

Luke hung the chart on the end of the bed and wheeled his equipment trolley towards the nurses’ station. There were </pre></div>                                                                    </div>
