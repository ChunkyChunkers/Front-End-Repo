    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <h5>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h5>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which
        also
        includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is
        used
        for control of buoyancy.

        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
        which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species,
        the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]

        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
        include
        dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a cuttlefish is
        about
        1-2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish
        also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]

        The "cuttle" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species, cudele, which may be cognate with
        the
        Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5] The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish
        as a
        source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed. The word for it in
        both
        Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English

    <h2>Fossil record</h2>
    <p>
        The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the Cretaceous period.[6][7] represented by Ceratisepia from the Late
        Maastrichtian-Paleocene.[8] Whether the earlier Trachyteuthis is assigned to this order, or to the Octopodiformes,
        remains unclear.[9]
    </p>

    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>

    <p>
        S. mestus swimming (Australia)
        The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are mostly
        shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10] They have an unusual
        biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and the
        Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By the time
        the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep for these
        warm-water species to cross.[11] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the Mediterranean, North and
        Baltic seas, although populations may occur as far south as South Africa. They are found in sublittoral depths,
        between the low tide line and the edge of the continental shelf, to about 180 m (600 ft).[12] The cuttlefish is
        listed under the Red List category of "least concern" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This means that
        while some over-exploitation of the marine animal has occurred in some regions due to large-scale commercial
        fishing, their wide geographic range prevents them from being too threatened. Ocean acidification, however, caused
        largely by higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat.[13]

   <h2> Anatomy and physiology</h2>

<p>
        The characteristic W-shape of the cuttlefish eye
        Pupil expansion in Sepia officinalis
        Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of the
        cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[14] Superficial similarities between
        cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a
        smoothly curving W-shape.[15][16] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[17] they can perceive the polarization of
        light, which enhances their perception of contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor cells on their
        retinas (known as foveae), one to look more forward, and one to look more backward. The eye changes focus by
        shifting the position of the entire lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the lens as in mammals.
        Unlike the vertebrate eye, no blind spot exists, because the optic nerve is positioned behind the retina. They are
        capable of using stereopsis, enabling them to discern depth/distance because their brain calculates the input from
        both eyes.[18][19]
    
        The cuttlefish's eyes are thought to be fully developed before birth, and they start observing their surroundings
        while still in the egg. In consequence, they may prefer to hunt the prey they saw before hatching.[20]
    
        Circulatory system
        The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it uses the copper-containing protein
        haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of the red, iron-containing protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood. The
        blood is pumped by three separate hearts: two branchial hearts pump blood to the cuttlefish's pair of gills (one
        heart for each), and the third pumps blood around the rest of the body. Cuttlefish blood must flow more rapidly than
        that of most other animals because haemocyanin carries substantially less oxygen than haemoglobin. Unlike most other
        mollusks, cephalopods like cuttlefish have a closed circulatory system.[21]

    <h2>Cuttlebone</h2>
    <h5>Main article: Cuttlebone</h5>


    <p>
        Top and bottom view of a cuttlebone, the buoyancy organ and internal shell of a cuttlefish
        Cuttlefish possess an internal structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous and is made of aragonite. The pores
        provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered
        cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle.[22] Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges
        or texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features that distinguish them from their
        squid relatives.[23]
    </p>

   <h2> Ink</h2>
   <p>
        Like other marine mollusks, cuttlefish have ink stores that are used for chemical deterrence, phagomimicry, sensory
        distraction, and evasion when attacked.[24] Its composition results in a dark colored ink, rich in ammonium salts
        and amino acids that may have a role in phagomimicry defenses.[24] The ink can be ejected to create a "smoke screen"
        to hide the cuttlefish's escape, or it can be released as a pseudomorph of similar size to the cuttlefish, acting as
        a decoy while the cuttlefish swims away.[25]
   </p>

   <p>
        Human use of this substance is wide-ranged. A common use is in cooking with squid ink to darken and flavor rice and
        pasta. It adds a black tint and a sweet flavor to the food. In addition to food, cuttlefish ink can be used with
        plastics and staining of materials.[citation needed] The diverse composition of cuttlefish ink, and its deep
        complexity of colors, allows for dilution and modification of its color. Cuttlefish ink can be used to make
        noniridescent reds, blues, and greens,[26] subsequently used for biomimetic colors and materials.[citation needed]
   </p>

    <h2>Arms and mantle cavity</h2>
   <p>
        Cuttlefish have eight arms and two additional elongated tentacles that are used to grasp prey. The elongated
        tentacles and mantle cavity serve as defense mechanisms; when approached by a predator, the cuttlefish can suck
        water into its mantle cavity and spread its arms in order to appear larger than normal.[27] Though the mantle cavity
        is used for jet propulsion, the main parts of the body that are used for basic mobility are the fins, which can
        maneuver the cuttlefish in all directions.[28]

   </p>    
    <h2>Suckers and venom</h2>
    <p>
        The suckers of cuttlefish extend most of the length of their arms and along the distal portion of their tentacles.
        Like other cephalopods, cuttlefish have "taste-by-touch" sensitivity in their suckers, allowing them to discriminate
        among objects and water currents that they contact.[29]
    </p>

    <p>
        Some cuttlefish are venomous. The genes for venom production are thought to be descended from a common ancestor.[30]
        The muscles of the flamboyant cuttlefish (Metasepia pfefferi) contain a highly toxic, unidentified compound[4] as
        lethal as that of a fellow cephalopod, the blue-ringed octopus.[31]
    </p>

    <h2>Sleep-like behavior</h2>
    <p>
        Sleep is a state of immobility characterized by being rapidly reversible, homeostatically controlled, and increasing
        an organism's arousal threshold.[32][33]
    </p>

    <p>
        To date one cephalopod species, Octopus vulgaris, has been shown to satisfy these criteria.[34] Another species,
        Sepia officinalis, satisfies two of the three criteria but has not yet been tested on the third (arousal
        threshold).[33][32] Recent research shows that the sleep-like state in a common species of cuttlefish, Sepia
        officinalis, shows predictable periods[33] of rapid eye movement, arm twitching and rapid chromatophore changes.[32]
    </p>

    <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
    <p>
        The lifespan of cuttlefish is typically around one to two years, depending on the species. They hatch from eggs
        fully developed, around 6 mm (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> in) long, reaching 25 mm (1 in) around the first two months. Before death,
        cuttlefish go through senescence when the cephalopod essentially deteriorates, or rots in place. Their eyesight
        begins to fail, which affects their ability to see, move, and hunt efficiently. Once this process begins, cuttlefish
        tend to not live long due to predation by other organisms.
    </p>

    <h2>Reproduction</h2>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish start to actively mate at around five months of age. Male cuttlefish challenge one another for dominance
        and the best den during mating season. During this challenge, no direct contact is usually made. The animals
        threaten each other until one of them backs down and swims away. Eventually, the larger male cuttlefish mate with
        the females by grabbing them with their tentacles, turning the female so that the two animals are face-to-face, then
        using a specialized tentacle to insert sperm sacs into an opening near the female's mouth. As males can also use
        their funnels to flush others' sperm out of the female's pouch, the male then guards the female until she lays the
        eggs a few hours later.[35] After laying her cluster of eggs, the female cuttlefish secretes ink on them making them
        look very similar to grapes. The egg case is produced through a complex capsule of the female accessory genital
        glands and the ink bag.[36]

    </p>
    <p>
        On occasion, a large competitor arrives to threaten the male cuttlefish. In these instances, the male first attempts
        to intimidate the other male. If the competitor does not flee, the male eventually attacks it to force it away. The
        cuttlefish that can paralyze the other first, by forcing it near its mouth, wins the fight and the female. Since
        typically four or five (and sometimes as many as 10) males are available for every female, this behavior is
        inevitable.[37]
    </p>

    <p>
        Cuttlefish are indeterminate growers, so smaller cuttlefish always have a chance of finding a mate the next year
        when they are bigger.[38] Additionally, cuttlefish unable to win in a direct confrontation with a guard male have
        been observed employing several other tactics to acquire a mate. The most successful of these methods is camouflage;
        smaller cuttlefish use their camouflage abilities to disguise themselves as a female cuttlefish. Changing their body
        color, and even pretending to be holding an egg sack, disguised males are able to swim past the larger guard male
        and mate with the female.[37][39][40]
    </p>

    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <p>
        Cephalopods are able to communicate visually using a diverse range of signals. To produce these signals, cephalopods
        can vary four types of communication element: chromatic (skin coloration), skin texture (e.g. rough or smooth),
        posture, and locomotion. Changes in body appearance such as these are sometimes called polyphenism. The common
        cuttlefish can display 34 chromatic, six textural, eight postural and six locomotor elements, whereas flamboyant
        cuttlefish use between 42 and 75 chromatic, 14 postural, and seven textural and locomotor elements. The Caribbean
        reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) is thought to have up to 35 distinct signalling states.[41][42]
